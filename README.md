# Silence-Removal-Using-MATLAB
The main aim of the project is to remove the silence part, where nobody speaks from an audio signal.
This has been implemented using speech processing techniques in MATLAB platform.
The key takeaways from the entire project is that it helps in easy processing of the audio signal by removing the unwanted part.
This has been achieved by taking a particular amplitude threshold and then comparing the amplitude of th audio signal with it.If found below that amplitude, that particular portion is removed from the audio signal.
