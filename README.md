# Silence-Removal-Using-MATLAB
## The main aim of the project is to remove the silence part, where nobody speaks from an audio signal.
### 1. This has been implemented using speech processing techniques in MATLAB platform.
### 2. The key takeaways from the entire project is that it helps in easy processing of the audio signal by removing the unwanted part.
### 3. This has been achieved by taking a particular amplitude threshold and then comparing the amplitude of th audio signal with it.If found below that amplitude, that particular portion is removed from the audio signal.
